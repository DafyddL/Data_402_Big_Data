# Cloud

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of various services through the internet, including storage, processing power, and software applications. 
Instead of maintaining physical servers or personal devices for these functions, users can access and manage these resources online.
## How de we know if something is in the cloud?
There are five ways to know if something is in the cloud:
1. We access the service via the internet.
2. Subscription based model – Cloud services are often offered as a subscription.
3. Scalability – Cloud services can scale resources up or down based on demand.
4. Remote accessibility - Cloud service can often be accessed from multiple devices and locations.
5. Lack of Local Installation - If you don't need to install software on your local machine to use the service, then it is likely in the cloud.
## Differences between on-prem and cloud?

On-prem describes using machines that are build on location, whereas cloud is for using cloud based services for deployment.
Here are the main differences:

|                         | On-Prem                                                                         | Cloud                                                                              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure and Deployment | Hardware and software are owned, managed, and located on-site.                  | Resources are hosted off-site by a cloud provider and accessed via the internet.   |
| Cost                          | High upfront costs for hardware and ongoing maintenance expenses.               | Minimal initial costs with a pay-as-you-go model.                                  |
| Scalability                   | Limited by physical capacity; scaling up is slow and expensive.                 | Highly scalable with near-instantaneous adjustments based on demand.               |
| Maintenance and Management    | Organization is responsible for all maintenance and updates.                    | Cloud provider handles maintenance and updates.                                    |
| Security and Compliance       | Direct control over security and easier to meet specific compliance needs.      | Robust security from providers; compliance varies but often meets many standards.  |
| Flexibility and Innovation    | Less flexible and slower to adopt new technologies.                             | High flexibility and access to advanced tools and services for innovation.         |
| Performance and Reliability   | High performance locally, but dependent on in-house management for reliability. | High performance with global distribution and built-in redundancy for reliability. |
| Disaster Recovery and Backup  | Requires additional investment and complex planning.                            | Integrated disaster recovery and backup solutions.                                 |

## The 4 deployment models of cloud
### Private
A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization. 
It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider but remains exclusively accessible by that organization.
Benefits:
- **Control:** Greater control over hardware, software, and data security.
- **Customisation:** Can be tailored to the specific needs of the organisation.
- **Security:** Enhanced security and privacy, ideal for sensitive data and compliance requirements.

Use Cases:
- Large enterprises with strict regulatory or security requirements
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare organisations
### Public
A public cloud is a cloud infrastructure provided by third-party service providers over the internet, available to the general public.
Benefits:
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing, reducing capital expenditures.
- **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited scalability with resources available on demand.
- **Maintenance**: The provider handles all infrastructure maintenance and management.

Use cases:
- Startups
- Small to medium sized businesses
- Applications with variable workloads
### Hybrid
A hybrid cloud combines private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
Benefits:
 - **Flexibility**: Can run sensitive workloads in the private cloud and less critical workloads in the public cloud. 
 - **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize costs by balancing between private and public clouds. 
 - **Scalability**: Allows scalability by offloading excess demand to the public cloud.

Use Cases:
- Businesses needing a mix of both private and public cloud benefits
- Businesses with fluctuating workloads
- Businesses requiring disaster recovery solutions
### Multi-Cloud
A multi-cloud strategy uses multiple public cloud services from different providers, avoiding dependency on a single provider.
Benefits:
- **Redundancy**: Increased reliability and redundancy by distributing workloads across multiple cloud environments.
- **Flexibility**: Choose the best services from each provider to meet specific business or technical needs.
- **Avoid Vendor Lock-In**: Reduces dependency on a single cloud provider.

Use Cases:
- Enterprises seeking to optimize performance, cost, and reliability
- Those wanting to mitigate risks associated with a single provider

## Types of cloud service
### IaaS
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networks.

Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS). Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### PaaS
Platform as a Service offers hardware and software tools over the internet. 
It is used for application development without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services

### SaaS
Software as a Service delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. 
Users can access these applications via web browsers without installation.

- **Performance Variability** - Performance can be affected by network latency and other factors beyond the organization’s control.
- **Complexity** - Managing and integrating multiple cloud services can add complexity to IT operations.
- **Data Transfer Costs** - Transferring large volumes of data to and from the cloud can incur significant costs.
- **Limited Customization** - Less ability to customize infrastructure compared to on-premises solutions.
## OpEx and CapEx
Capital Expenditure (CapEx) refers to the funds used by an organization to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, buildings, or equipment. 
These expenses are typically one-time, significant investments.

Operational Expenditure (OpEx) refers to the ongoing expenses required for the day-to-day running of a business. 
These expenses are typically regular, recurring costs that are fully deductible in the same fiscal year they are incurred.


Cloud services are typically considered under OpEx, as they are subscription based.
They also almost eliminate the CapEx, as the cost to intially setup equipment for purpose does not exist.
## Is migrating to the cloud always cheaper?

Not always, there are many factors specific to each individual organisation.

### Potential Cost Savings
- Lower upfront costs
- Scalability - pay as you go scaling allows for lower costs during periods of low usage
- Maintenance and upgrades – handled by the cloud provider
- Energy costs
- Rapid deployment - quickly deploy and scale applications without waiting for new hardware
- Global reach - global infrastructure of cloud providers allows reaching worldwide
